# Operating Manual: TLAAS Model

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Release Date:** [Current Date]

## 1. System Requirements

To ensure the proper functioning of the TLAAS Model script, the following environment is recommended:

### Hardware
*   **CPU:** Intel Core i5 or higher (or equivalent AMD processor).
*   **RAM:** 8 GB minimum (16 GB recommended for high-resolution images).
*   **GPU:** Optional (The script is optimized for CPU execution; CUDA acceleration is not required).

### Software
*   **Platform:** Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux.
*   **Environment:** MATLAB R2022b or later.
*   **Required Toolboxes:**
    *   Image Processing Toolbox™

## 2. Installation

This software is provided as a standalone MATLAB script and does not require a binary installation.

1.  **Download:** Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/TLAAS-Model.git
    ```
2.  **Directory:** Extract the files to a local directory accessible by MATLAB.

## 3. Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Data
Place your test images in the `samples/` folder or any directory of your choice. Supported formats include `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.bmp`.

### Step 2: Configure Path
Open `main.m` in the MATLAB Editor. Locate **Line 18**:
```matlab
imgPath = 'samples/sample_01.jpg'; % Update this path
Change the string to point to your target image file.

Step 3: Execution
Click the Run button in the MATLAB toolbar or press F5.

Step 4: Interpret Results
The script will generate:

Console Output: Processing time (e.g., "Processing completed in 1.49 seconds.").
Figure Window: An overlay image showing the segmentation results:
Red Regions: Identified Adaxial (Upper) Surface.
Blue Regions: Identified Abaxial (Lower) Surface.
Original Color: Background or filtered artifacts (shadows/stems).

4. Version Control & Reproducibility
Versioning: This project utilizes Semantic Versioning (SemVer). The current release is v1.0.0, corresponding to the code used in the published manuscript.
Reproducibility: To reproduce the results reported in the paper, use the images provided in the samples/ folder. While the full dataset is restricted, these samples are validated to produce consistent segmentation metrics.

5. Troubleshooting
Error: "Undefined function 'bwareaopen'..."
Solution: Ensure the Image Processing Toolbox is installed and licensed.
Poor Segmentation Results:
Solution: The model parameters (e.g., threshold 0.2 for V channel) are optimized for standard curing factory lighting (approx. 6500K). For images with significantly different lighting, adjust the thresholds in Section 2 of the script.
